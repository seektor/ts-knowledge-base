## Typescript

  > Visual Studio Code includes TypeScript language support but does not include the TypeScript compiler, tsc . You will need to install the TypeScript compiler either globally or in your workspace to transpile TypeScript source code to JavaScript

      npx tsc --init

       More like a trivia

  > As a recap of that previous blog post, if youâ€™re using an npm package named foo-bar and it doesnâ€™t ship any .d.ts files, you can just run

      npm install -S @types/foo-bar

We can write our own TypeScript Declaration files or have them produced from the compilation of TypeScript files (.ts) by setting declaration compiler-option to true in the tsconfig.json file (or using--declaration flag with the tsc command).

ðŸ’¡ The reason we need to add declare keyword while declaring a namespace is that the declaration files (.d.ts) can only contain types and not values. Since namespace is a value, we canâ€™t declare it inside a declaration file but we can write an abient declaration of it that contains only types.
